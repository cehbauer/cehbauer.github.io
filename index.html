		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

		<p>I am most inspired by the <a href="www.helmsworkship.com">Helms Workshop</a> and <a href="www.anthropologie.com">Anthropologie</a> websites.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

		<p>Both sites have a strong emphasis on art and design.  Anthropologie's site prominently features a great deal of photography combined with illustration, while Helms Workshop highlights a lot of illustration in addition to photos of their portfolio. They both utilize white space and are very balanced.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

		<p>Many elements are similar, but you can see that the Helms Workshop site is comprised of three columns, with rotating images at the top that span the three columns. The Anthropologie site is static, while Helms Workshop has moving images that switch every few seconds. Both utilize a lot of color and visual imagery. The imagery featured on both sites is clearly the focus, with text being secondary.</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Index</strong> <br>
				<br>
				<img src="cravindexpage.jpg" alt="Crav Home Page" height="349" width="432"><br>
				<br>
			
			<li><strong>About</strong> <br>
				<br>
				<img src="cravaboutpage.jpg" alt="Crav About Page" height="349" width="433">

		</ul>

		<p>The focal point of the Index page is the image of food in the background. It is a large image that spans the three columns that make up the page and takes up most of the spaee.  The hierarchy is determined by the menu on the left that is vertical. The footer consists of 3 spaces where social media feeds will appear and/or messages about upcoming classes, etc. Balance is achieved by having the logo at the top of the page anchored by the three boxes at the bottom.</p>

		<p>The focal point of the About page is primarily the text that is floating over the large image in the background. Also floating over the background image are three other images that illustrate the type of food and ingredients used. The three images anchor the text and are centered and justified under it. Again, the logo is at the top left.</p>
